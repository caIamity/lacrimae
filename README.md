# üôè Lacrimae
Small [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) plugin that prints a line from a collection of chants i enjoy. Not affiliated with any religion (i think).

Each line is written in the original language of the chant, along with the name/source of the chant.

[Preview](https://github.com/caIamity/lacrimae/blob/main/preview/lacrimae_preview.png)

Chants are classified by
 - Templar chants
 - Byzantine chants
 - Gregorian chants
 - Warhammer chants (for nerds)


I update the plugin by a single criteria : Do I get goosebumps when I hear the line ?
