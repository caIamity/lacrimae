# 🙏 Lacrimae
Small oh-my-zsh plugin that prints a line from a collection of chants i enjoy. Not affiliated with any religion (i think).

Each line is written in the original language of the chant, along with the name/source of the chant.

Preview :

Chants are classified by
 - Templar chants
 - Byzantine chants
 - Gregorian chants
 - Warhammer chants (for nerds)


I update the plugin by a single criteria : Do I get goosebumps when I hear the line ?
